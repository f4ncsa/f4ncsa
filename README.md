# Welcome

Namaste üôè

I balance being highly analytical and boldly artistic. I always strive for perfection and quality in whatever I do with great attention to details. I consider myself creative and critical. I like to look for beauty and positivity in life and I seek to bring those qualities into my work environment.
Huge advocate for smoothless user experience.
Love coding any UI heavy stuff and animations. 

Have an endless list of hobbies.
